Work out what exceptions the Trello library is likey to throw, trap 
and handle etc. and disconnect from net because cannot remember what 
the exceptions are, then centralise exception handling in the Trello client.
Just have it throw a custom exception that the top-level filters can catch
and show message to user.

- add board/list/card name to views

- how to handle when Trello logon expires?

- length validation etc before hitting Trello (pretty sure this can be enforced at the model?)

- move Token & ID into a base class for all Trelo models.

- write "installation" docs
