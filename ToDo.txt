 - use full models instead of List<>, add display name etc.

 - work out what exceptions the Trello library is likey to throw, trap and handle etc.

 - disconnect from net because cannot remember what the exceptions are...

 - length validation etc before hitting Trello (pretty sure this can be enforced at the model?)
